# Image Uploader

This project was created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and Typescript.

Project was created as part of one of the ['DevChallenges'](https://devchallenges.io/) challenges.

The challenge consisted in create an Image Uploader application with its own API. 

Also Fulfill the user stories below:

- "I can drag and drop an image to upload it."
- "I can choose to select an image from my folder."
- "I can see a loader when uploading."
- "When the image is uploaded, I can see the image and copy it."
- "I can choose to copy to the clipboard."

There was a design provided in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/NxbZm3CAovYh89dFXe7EOw/Image-Uploader?node-id=1%3A9&t=4DjzBygdhguGzGIV-0).
